# Predicting the HouseSales 

## Project Description:
## Given three comma-seperated-value files (house_sales, train & validation) 
### This project is an inspiration from the DataCamp's Associate Data Scientist Certification Practical Exam. Here in this notebook file, I have tried to solve the problem by preprocessing the data, applying extensive EDA, Visualizations and then the Machine Learning. For that, I used two robust models, Linear Regression & Random Forest Regressor due to the nature of variables. The house_sales.csv comprises of 1500 rows and 8 columns. After letting the Machine learn the Algorithm, I recieved a handsome RMSE of a price of 18163.2.
